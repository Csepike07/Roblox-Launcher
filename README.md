# Roblox-Launcher
It is a simple to use Roblox Exploit. The Exploit implements simple cheats like Wall Hack and Speed Hack with easy to use buttons.
For advanced cheaters I created an RLua coding site. The Exploit currently cannot disable FE in-game, but I am working on a system,
that could turn it off.

# FE Protecrted
FE means Filtering Enabled, it's a new Roblox anti-cheat. It simply disables client made changes in the server, that's why you are the
only who sees the effects of it. But I guess it can be disabled via in-game, because we can send RLua scripts and access Instances
of the game. And with that you can turn off and on FE because it a property of the game.Workspace. Anyway that's just a dream, but once
will work I guess.

# NOTE: THE EXPLOIT IS CURRENTLY IN THE TESTING STATE SO DO NOT BE SURPRISED WHEN IT THROWS JS OR C# ERRORS.
